## Notebook Pipeline (run in order)
```
01_schema_setup.py → 02_bronze_autoloader.py → 03_silver_decoder.py →
   ├─→ 04_gold_metrics.py            (annual, 10-K)
   └─→ 04b_gold_quarterly_metrics.py (quarterly, 10-Q — Q1/Q2/Q3 only)
05_vector_chunker.py (10-K + 10-Q) → 06_rag_agent.py → 07_evaluation.py
```
(Actual file names on disk — the old README spelling `01_bronze_ingestor / 02_xbrl_parser` was aspirational.)

---

## Layer 1: Bronze (`main.finsage_bronze`)
- **`filings`** — raw HTML/text as BINARY, ingested via Auto Loader (`cloudFiles`) from `/Volumes/main/finsage_bronze/raw_filings/`
- **`xbrl_companyfacts_raw`** — raw JSON payloads from SEC EDGAR CompanyFacts API
- **`ingestion_errors`** — captures failures from Autoloader, Silver parsing, JSON flattening
- All tables: append-only, `delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true`

## Layer 2: Silver (`main.finsage_silver`)

### `filing_sections`
- 10-K sections: **"Business"**, **"Risk Factors"**, **"MD&A"** (taxonomy `CANONICAL_10K`)
- 10-Q sections: **"MD&A"** (Part I, Item 2) and optionally **"Risk Factors Updates"** (Part II, Item 1A when present) — taxonomy `CANONICAL_10Q`
- **Extractor**: `sec-parser` (DOM-aware iXBRL parser) is the primary path; the legacy regex extractor is a per-section tier-2 fallback. `extract_sections` first runs sec-parser and collects whatever sections it classifies; the regex fallback then runs *only for the required sections sec-parser missed*, and its output is merged by section name (sec-parser wins on ties). A whole-filing fallback (the old all-or-nothing behavior) was the cause of MD&A / Risk Factors being silently dropped for JPM / BAC / MA / PFE 10-K and MSFT 10-Q — see Challenge 9 / Decision 11 in `docs/`.
- `extractor_used ∈ {"sec-parser", "regex-fallback", NULL}` is **persisted per row** on `filing_sections` (lands on the existing table via `schema.autoMerge.enabled=true`). `NULL` rows are definitionally stale — not written by the current extractor code (they predate this column and must be re-merged by a fresh notebook run). The VS chunker (notebook 05) should filter `WHERE extractor_used IS NOT NULL` so stale rows never reach the embedding index.
- **Heading-preference rule in `_sec_parser_extract._find_heading`**: when multiple heading elements match a section regex, anchors whose text is ≤ 12 chars (TOC-style stubs like a bare `"Item 2"`) are filtered out in favor of descriptive full headings. Falls back to the original first-match-wins if no substantive match exists, so previously-working filers are unaffected. This recovers all 19 MSFT 10-Q MD&A extractions.
- Why the swap: the old regex-on-flattened-HTML path was 100% broken on AMZN/V (0 sections for ~50 filings each) and had thousands of partial failures across the other 28 tickers. Root causes: unescaped `&#160;`/`&#8217;` entities breaking the `item\s+1\b` anchors; iXBRL span fragmentation putting "Item" and "1" in separate DOM elements; page-footer leakage into section bodies. sec-parser operates on the DOM so all three fall away. See `03_silver_decoder.py` module docstring for the full rationale.
- SGML unwrap is now by `<TYPE>` match (picks the main 10-K/10-Q DOCUMENT block deterministically) rather than "first document wins" — matters for filings where a cover-page iXBRL doc precedes the main body.
- `filing_type` is persisted on the row so downstream chunking / retrieval can filter annual vs. interim
- Records word counts per section; parsing errors go to `ingestion_errors` with `error_type='parse_failure'` and a message that distinguishes sec-parser-only vs. fallback-path failures
- Write strategy: **MERGE INTO on `section_id`** (idempotent). `section_id = sha2(filing_id || section_name)` — `filing_id` is already unique per SEC accession so no form tag needed in the hash
- `filing_type` column was added post-v1; the write uses `spark.databricks.delta.schema.autoMerge.enabled=true` to land the column on an existing table
- **CDF enabled** (`delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true`) — required for Vector Search incremental sync
- Cluster dependency: `sec-parser>=0.58.0` installed via `%pip install --quiet sec-parser "numpy<2"` at the top of notebook 03. Two gotchas the pin guards against:
  - **Don't pin `lxml`** — DBR ships a native-extension lxml; forcing an upgrade replaces the binary with an ABI-mismatched wheel and breaks the kernel on `restartPython()` with exit code 1 and empty stdout.
  - **`numpy<2` is critical** — `sec-parser` declares `pandas` as a dep, and pip's resolver will transitively upgrade NumPy to 2.x when installing a fresh pandas. DBR 14.x's pyarrow C extension is compiled against NumPy 1.x ABI and fails to import under NumPy 2.x (`AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found`), which crashes the kernel on boot when `dbruntime.PipMagicOverrides` imports pandas → pyarrow. Pinning `numpy<2` keeps the runtime's NumPy 1.x and forces pip to resolve a pandas compatible with it. Remove this pin only after the cluster runtime advertises pyarrow compiled for NumPy 2.x (DBR 16+).

### `financial_statements`
- Maps US-GAAP XBRL JSON keys → normalized canonical metrics (`revenue`, `net_income`, `equity`, etc.)
- Unique `statement_id` via SHA256 hash of ticker + accession + line item
- Write strategy: **MERGE INTO on `statement_id`**

## Layer 3: Gold (`main.finsage_gold`)

### `company_metrics` (annual, 10-K-sourced)
- **~180 rows, 30 tickers, FY2020–FY2026**
- Only 10-K annual (`fiscal_period == 'FY'`) filings from 2020+. Quarterly data lives in the parallel `company_metrics_quarterly` table — do NOT try to fold Q data into this one.
- `annual_fit_score`: duration_days between 350–380 for flow metrics
- `instant_fit_score`: balance sheet point-in-time metrics
- Canonical accession selection per ticker-year by `concept_priority` hierarchy
- **Columns**: `ticker`, `company_name`, `fiscal_year`, `fiscal_quarter` (always `NULL` in this table — the quarter dimension is reserved so the merge key stays uniform with the quarterly table), `revenue`, `net_income`, `gross_profit`, `operating_income`, `operating_cash_flow`, `total_assets`, `total_liabilities`, `total_equity`, `total_debt`, `rd_expense`, `gross_margin_pct`, `revenue_yoy_growth_pct`, `debt_to_equity`, `data_quality_score`, `updated_at`
- `total_equity` was added in the robustness pass — computed as `coalesce(equity_tag, total_assets − total_liabilities)`. `debt_to_equity` now uses this derived value so the ratio populates for tickers whose XBRL omits a StockholdersEquity concept.
- **CRITICAL**: `fiscal_year` is stored as `double` — always cast with `int(fy)` when displaying.
- Write strategy: **MERGE INTO on `ticker + fiscal_year + fiscal_quarter`** with `schema.autoMerge.enabled=true` so the new `total_equity` column lands without a rebuild.

### `company_metrics_quarterly` (interim, 10-Q-sourced)
- Built by notebook `04b_gold_quarterly_metrics.py` — parallel pipeline, same concept-priority taxonomy as the annual table.
- Filters `filing_type == '10-Q'` and `fiscal_period IN ('Q1','Q2','Q3')` — Q4 standalone is NOT stored (would have to be derived as `FY − (Q1+Q2+Q3)`; deferred to v2).
- **Discrete Q2/Q3 flows are derived by subtraction** — most filers XBRL-tag only the cumulative concepts in Q2/Q3 10-Qs (`SixMonthsEnded`, `NineMonthsEnded`), so silver has zero 80–100 day `revenue` facts at `fiscal_period='Q2'` or `'Q3'`. The notebook classifies each fact as `period_type ∈ {discrete, ytd_6mo, ytd_9mo, instant}`, wide-aggregates per `(ticker, fy)`, then unpivots into Q1/Q2/Q3 rows with:
  - `Q1 = discrete`
  - `Q2 = coalesce(Q2_90d_tagged, Q2_YTD_6mo − Q1_90d)`
  - `Q3 = coalesce(Q3_90d_tagged, Q3_YTD_9mo − Q2_YTD_6mo)`
  - F/GM/RIVN are the only tickers in the current set that directly tag discrete Q2/Q3 flows; the `coalesce` prefers their direct value over the subtraction when available.
- `period_end_dt DESC` is the primary `fact_window` tiebreaker — silver contains prior-year comparatives stamped with the current `fiscal_year` (embedded in the same 10-Q); the current-period fact always has a later `period_end_dt` than its comparative, so this deterministically discards the comparative. Do NOT gate on `period_end_year == fiscal_year` — that would drop ~100% of fiscal-year-offset companies' (AAPL/MSFT/NKE/V/WMT) legitimate Q1 discrete facts.
- `revenue_yoy_growth_pct` uses a **same-quarter prior-year** window (`Window.partitionBy("ticker","fiscal_quarter").orderBy("fiscal_year")`), not adjacent rows.
- Adds `period_end_date` (actual quarter-end date, pulled preferentially from instant facts) and `source_filing_type = '10-Q'` columns vs. the annual shape.
- Merge key: **`ticker + fiscal_year + fiscal_quarter`** (disjoint from annual where `fiscal_quarter IS NULL`).

### `filing_section_chunks`
- LangChain text splitter chunks from Silver `filing_sections`
- Source for Vector Search index (actual table name is `filing_section_chunks`, not `filing_chunks`)
- Now carries `filing_type` so retrieval can scope 10-K vs. 10-Q (chunker auto-backfills `'10-K'` for rows that predate the column)

### `filing_chunks_index`
- Databricks Vector Search index (DELTA_SYNC, TRIGGERED pipeline)
- Embeddings: BGE-large-en
- Endpoint: `finsage_vs_endpoint`
- **45,136 chunks, 728 filings, 30 tickers** (as of 2026-05-05; full 10-K + 10-Q coverage)
- Filterable columns: `ticker`, `section_name`, `fiscal_year`

### `finsage_rag_agent`
- UC-registered MLflow pyfunc model (current version: **16**, deployed and serving)
- Deployed to Model Serving endpoint: `finsage_agent_endpoint` (state: `READY`, scaled-to-zero)
- Redeploys are automated via the `finsage-log-and-deploy-agent` job (id `790463778829808`, created via AI Dev Kit 2026-04-20) — runs notebook `06_rag_agent.py` end-to-end on serverless

---

## Layer 4: RAG Agent (`databricks/notebooks/06_rag_agent.py`)

### Design
- **Framework**: `mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel` — zero LangChain dependency
- **LLM**: `databricks-meta-llama-3-3-70b-instruct` (function-calling, READY)
- **Tracing**: `@mlflow.trace` on `predict()`, `search_filings()`, `get_company_metrics()` + `mlflow.start_span` per tool call
- **Tool loop**: max 5 iterations before forcing final answer

### Tools
1. **`search_filings(query, ticker, section_name, fiscal_year, filing_type, num_results, similarity_threshold)`**
   - Semantic search over `filing_chunks_index` (10-K + 10-Q chunks)
   - `fiscal_year` filter prevents multi-year chunk mixing
   - `filing_type` ∈ {`10-K`, `10-Q`} scopes to annual vs interim; omit to search both
   - `section_name` enum: `Business`, `Risk Factors` (10-K only), `MD&A` (both), `Risk Factors Updates` (10-Q Part II Item 1A)
   - Output format: `[Source: TICKER | FY{int(fy)} | FilingType | Section]`

2. **`get_company_metrics(ticker, fiscal_year_start, fiscal_year_end)`** — ANNUAL
   - In-memory lookup from `METRICS_CACHE` (loaded at `load_context` — no SQL warehouse needed in serving)
   - Cache structure: `{ticker_str: {fiscal_year_int: {metric: value}}}`
   - Sourced from `company_metrics` (10-K).

3. **`get_quarterly_metrics(ticker, fiscal_year, fiscal_quarter, fiscal_year_start, fiscal_year_end)`** — INTERIM
   - In-memory lookup from `QUARTERLY_METRICS_CACHE`
   - Cache structure: `{ticker_str: {"YYYY-QN": {metric: value}}}` (string keys because JSON can't hold tuple keys; Q-key parsing handled by the tool)
   - Sourced from `company_metrics_quarterly` (10-Q, Q1/Q2/Q3 only).
   - The quarterly cache artifact is OPTIONAL at `load_context` time — if the table doesn't exist yet (e.g. fresh deployment before 04b has run), the agent logs a warning and the tool returns an actionable error instead of crashing.

### SYSTEM_PROMPT behavioral rules (do not remove these)
- Annual / fiscal-year questions → `get_company_metrics`. Interim / Q-specific questions → `get_quarterly_metrics`. Q4 is unavailable in the quarterly tool — fall back to annual and flag the limitation.
- For "most recent" questions: call the appropriate metrics tool first to find latest year (+ quarter if interim) → pass `fiscal_year` to `search_filings`
- Citation labelling: `[VERBATIM]` for direct quotes, `[SUMMARY]` for paraphrases
- Formula disclosure: state formula on first use — e.g. `Operating Margin (GAAP) = Operating Income ÷ Revenue`

### Smoke test (cell 8)
- `fake_ctx.artifacts` must be a **plain dict**, now with two keys: `{"metrics_cache": "/tmp/metrics_cache.json", "quarterly_cache": "/tmp/quarterly_cache.json"}` — NOT a class instance
- MLflow experiment: do NOT call `mlflow.set_experiment()` inside a Git Folder notebook (raises `INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE`) — remove it, use default experiment
- Live endpoint test: use `w.serving_endpoints.query()` — NOT `mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client()` (that resolves to wrong tokyo.cloud.databricks.com URL)

## Databricks SDK Quirks (this workspace)
These are version-specific — do not change without testing:
- `EndpointCoreConfigInput` requires `name=` as argument: `EndpointCoreConfigInput(name=AGENT_ENDPOINT, served_entities=[...])`
- `inference_table_config` kwarg not supported in `ServingEndpointsAPI.create()` — omit it
- `client.get_registered_model().latest_versions` is deprecated and returns empty — use `client.search_model_versions(f"name='{UC_MODEL_NAME}'")`
- `idx.sync()` in Vector Search SDK is blocking/hangs — wrap in daemon thread with 30s timeout, then poll state directly
- Endpoint READY check: use exact string match `state == "EndpointStateReady.READY"` — do NOT use `"READY" in state` (matches "NOT_READY" too)
- `ResourceDoesNotExist` import: `from databricks.sdk.errors import ResourceDoesNotExist`

---

## Variable Scoping Rule (Critical)
After `%pip install` + `dbutils.library.restartPython()`, ALL Python variables are wiped. Always re-read widgets and re-declare all constants immediately in the imports cell. Pattern used throughout notebook 06:
```python
CATALOG = dbutils.widgets.get("catalog")
# ... re-declare all constants
```

## Layer 5: Evaluation (`databricks/notebooks/07_evaluation.py` + `src/evaluation/`)

### Architecture
- **Dataset**: `src/evaluation/ground_truth_v2.json` — 100 stratified questions across 30 tickers, generated by `src/evaluation/builder/` and verified against SEC EDGAR. **Locked** — do not regenerate without bumping a versioned `ground_truth_v3.json`.
- **Scorers** (`src/evaluation/scorers.py`, all importable, all unit-tested in `tests/unit/test_scorers.py`):
  - `Correctness` (built-in LLM judge, llama-3.3-70b)
  - `cites_ticker_and_year` (Guidelines built-in)
  - `numerical_tolerance` — custom, ±1% with B/M/K-aware extraction
  - `citation_format` — custom, [VERBATIM]/[SUMMARY] + [Source: TICKER | FY...]
  - `refusal_correctness` — custom, validates refusal-test agent declined for the *right* reason (per-question expected context tokens in `_REFUSAL_CONTEXT_TOKENS`)
  - `tool_routing_correctness` — custom, validates the agent picked the right tool (annual / quarterly / metadata / search) by pattern-matching response source-line shape
  - `derived_metric_match` — custom, value extraction + tolerance, decoupled from natural-language wording — catches LLM-judge over-strictness on derived ratios
- **Persistence** (`src/evaluation/persistence.py`): two Delta tables under `main.finsage_gold`, both idempotent on `run_id`:
  - `eval_run_summaries` — one row per MLflow run with metrics JSON, agent_version, dataset_hash, git_commit
  - `eval_question_outcomes` — one row per (run_id, question_id, scorer) with PASS/FAIL/ERROR/SKIP, rationale, agent_response, expected_response — partitioned by run_id
- **Analysis** (`src/evaluation/analysis.py`): `summarize_run`, `failure_breakdown`, `category_matrix`, `regression_diff`, `question_flips`, `print_summary`. Pure-Spark, returns DataFrames.
- **Pre-flight smoke**: notebook 07 runs a 5-question subset (`A001/B001/C001/E001/F001`) through full eval before kicking off the 100-question run. Set widget `smoke_only=true` to stop after preflight.
- **`retrieval_grounded_when_used`** (custom replacement for MLflow's built-in `RetrievalGroundedness`): the built-in raises a hard error on any trace that lacks a `RETRIEVER` span, which broke our eval because the agent's `_deterministic_answer` shortcut handles ~95 of 100 questions without invoking `search_filings`. The custom scorer SKIPs (returns None) when no retrieval happened and only evaluates groundedness on traces that actually used `search_filings`.
- **In-process model load** with `unwrap_python_model()` — `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model("models:/main.finsage_gold.finsage_rag_agent/<latest>").unwrap_python_model()` returns the raw `FinSageAgent` instance, bypassing pyfunc's signature-driven dict-to-DataFrame coercion (which JSON-stringifies nested fields and breaks the agent's message parsing). Tool decorators (`@mlflow.trace(span_type=RETRIEVER|TOOL)`) emit child spans in the eval-notebook process when this path is taken.
- **Pre-flight validation**: `tests/unit/test_eval_preflight.py` (14 pytest cases, runs in <1s locally) catches dataset/schema/scorer-wiring regressions before the cluster spins up. Run before pushing notebook changes: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_eval_preflight.py -v`.
- **Failure-resilient cell layout**: 07_evaluation cell 8 splits into 8a (collect from MLflow REST), 8b (in-memory summary + per-failure drill-down — always works, no Spark dependency), 8c (Delta persistence — wrapped in try/except). Even if Delta writes fail, the user sees full eval results in cell 8b.

### Caching anomaly to know
`mlflow.genai.evaluate` with the same dataset against a warm endpoint can drop wall-time from 320s → 95s on subsequent runs (observed empirically). The harness appears to reuse cached predictions/judges across re-runs in the same MLflow experiment. Treat back-to-back identical-config runs as suspect for true regression detection — bump `eval_name` between runs, or wait long enough for caches to invalidate.

## What's Next (Pending)
1. **Re-run `07_evaluation.py`** — full pipeline now exercises 7 scorers, persists to Delta, and emits regression diff vs. previous run. Look for `derived_metric_match` and `tool_routing_correctness` to surface category-specific weaknesses; expect them to flag the same issues that the over-strict `correctness` LLM judge currently misclassifies.
2. **Address gold-data quality issues exposed by eval failures** (separate workstream): JNJ FY2022 `total_equity` cache divergence ($74B vs SEC's $76.8B — 52/53-week edge), BAC FY2022 missing `total_liabilities`, AMZN Q1 FY2024 quarterly cache gap, MCD negative `debt_to_equity` formatting.
3. **Re-instrument agent for RetrievalGroundedness** — switch eval to in-process model loading or stream the serving endpoint's inference table. Adds the 5th scorer dimension we currently skip.
4. **`08_knowledge_graph.py`** — Entity extraction from MD&A/Risk Factors using Graphify.
5. **CI/CD** — schedule `07_evaluation` weekly via Databricks Jobs; alert on `correctness/mean` drop > 5% week-over-week.

## Known Gaps (open, non-blocking)
- **MCD 10-K Silver gap**: 7 MCD 10-K filings exist in bronze but produced 0 rows in `filing_sections` (10-Q rows are fine — 18 filings / 36 sections). Annual XBRL metrics in `company_metrics` are unaffected (sourced from `financial_statements`), but MCD has no 10-K text chunks in the VS index — RAG will return nothing for MCD annual narrative questions. MCD is not in the `07` eval set, so non-blocking. Fix path: rerun `03_silver_decoder.py` scoped to MCD 10-Ks and inspect any new `parse_failure` rows.
- **NVDA FY2021 Q3 row**: `revenue` and `net_income` are null in `company_metrics_quarterly` (single historical row).

## Coding Standards
1. **Language**: ALWAYS English
2. **Databricks Native**: PySpark/Spark SQL for DBR 14.x+, UC 3-level namespace (`catalog.schema.table`), never raw DBFS paths
3. **Idempotency**: MERGE INTO always — never DROP TABLE, never mode("overwrite") on existing tables
4. **No hallucinated columns**: Verify column exists before referencing. Check `company_metrics` schema — `equity` does NOT exist there.
5. **fiscal_year display**: Always `int(fy)` — stored as double in Delta
6. **Concise expertise**: Production-ready code, no filler explanations, no generic comments
7. **No Claude/Sonnet mentions**: Never in commit messages, code comments, or anywhere in the repo

## Specialized Knowledge Directives
- **Databricks GenAI Cookbook**: Use Vector Search, Mosaic AI Model Serving, MLflow evaluate. Prefer `ai_query`/`ai_analyze` over third-party APIs.
- **Graphify** (`safishamsi/graphify`): Use for all Knowledge Graph work — LLM-assisted entity-relationship extraction with ontological schemas.
